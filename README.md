# Why make a research website as an academic?
- share your work
- connect with others
- aggregate your information in one place


# How?
Make use of one of Hugoâ€™s free templates and insert your content (contact information, project links, blogs)
Host on Github Pages and push updates as needed

# Example

alburycatalina.github.io/me

# Let's Get Started. You will need:
- Internet connection
- Github account and git
- Homebrew package manager (mac)
- VSCode
- A browser to view your site in construction



# Step 1: Setup
1. Install git on your machine: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Git is a kind of SCM (source code management) software. You can use it to track and finalize changes in code. Github is a place to store this version control information on the internet. Git is installed by default on most Mac and Linux machines. 




2. Install hugo : https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/. This can be done in a few ways, but an easy way is via homebrew if using a mac. 
  
  With homebrew: https://brew.sh/ (if work with python or ruby this may be familiar. Homebrew is a package manager)
  
  
  Install homebrew: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  
  `brew install hugo`
  
  
3. Install VS code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

VS code is an IDE (interactive development environment) that has lots of cool tools to help you manage your website. 




# Step 2: Make a new github repo 

Make github account if not have one already
Make github repo (main.github.io or main/thing.github.io)
